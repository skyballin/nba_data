    "A few of my thoughts on these questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) How do we define \"revolutionized the game\" analytically?\n",
    "\t- Perhaps we can use fan participation?\n",
    "\t- Maybe we can understand how the NBA market has changed over time usin viewership numbers? \n",
    "\n",
    "2) How do we define \"impacted the game\"? \n",
    "\t- Maybe we can look at 3pt'ers taken to fan base numbers/viewership relationship? \n",
    "\n",
    "3) What is the Steph Curry effect analytically?\n",
    "\t- This one is tougher for me to understand, especially, since i don't think it will help to answer the overall questions we are trying to answer. \n",
    "\t- Maybe we can do the same kinda replacement player stuff talked about below\n",
    "\n",
    "4) How do we define what \"worth it\" means? \n",
    "\t- Maybe we can use a replacement technique where we replace a player on a team with Mike Miller/Kyle Korver 3 pt numbers/fanbase contribution and see how our model estimates the fanbase numbers?\n",
    "\t- The concept of fanbase contribution is very interesting to me -- who are the money makers for the NBA? Why? What makes them a player that sells jerseys?\n",
    "5) What kinda data would we want to get to answer these questions? \n",
    "\t- we would need fan base numbers over time\n",
    "\t- we would need 3 pt statistics per team over time\n",
    "\t- we could get some tv data (viewership) over time/per game/per team\n",
    "\t- we could look at some jersey sales data over time"
